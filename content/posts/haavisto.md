Does Projekt Kateryna make sense from a politician's standpoint? We met with Finland's previous Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto earlier in the week, to seek for validation and advice. 

We got valuable input and data points, which we hope will give Kateryna significantly more momentum. And we left with the feeling that it's a resounding "yes!" â€“ the goals of Projekt Kateryna make a lot of sense in the world we live in.
